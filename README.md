# audio-experiments
A collection of experimental audio pieces that don't use any custom libraries to generate sound.

# Using the Program
To listen to the sounds that I've made, start the program after opening the solution and use numbers 1 to 0 on the number row to play a range of noises (with a little suprise at 0).

You can also play a 'piano' using keys A-L as the white notes and keys on the Q-P row as black notes.

That's about it!

# Credit
I didn't create the code that actually generates sound; this was created by StackOverflow user [Shawn Kovac](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2840284/shawn-kovac) and the code can be found in his answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12611982/generate-audio-tone-to-sound-card-in-c-or-c-sharp).

However, I did create the code that manipulates all this sound, including heavily modifying the function to carry out these manipulations.
